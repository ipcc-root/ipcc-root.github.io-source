The Princeton/Intel Parallel Computing Center to modernize [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) (IPCC ROOT) is funded via Intel's [Intel Parallel Computing Center (IPCC)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/ipcc) program. 

ROOT is a data analysis framework which enables big data processing, statistical analysis, visualization and storage in highly efficient manner. ROOT is open source software. It was begun nearly 20 years ago as part of the preparation for the scientific program of the [Large Hadron Collider](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider) at the [European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN)](http://home.web.cern.ch/), but has been widely adopted in particle and nuclear physics. It is used not only at CERN and by external scientists working at CERN, but also for experiments at many other physics laboratories around the world. It is used daily by an estimated community of 20000 scientists around the world, including non-physics applications ranging from finance to genomics. 

The compute needs of the LHC program are very large and will grow in a way that there is a significant pressure to optimize software codes like ROOT. The focus of the IPCC ROOT project is the modernization of the ROOT Math and I/O libraries.
